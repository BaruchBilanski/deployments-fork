# Aqua Enterprise Product Deployment

This is the repository for Aqua Enterprise product deployments.

[Aqua Enterprise](https://www.aquasec.com/products/aqua-cloud-native-security-platform/) is a layered, full-lifecycle cloud native security platform that secures containerized, serverless, and VM-based applications, from CI/CD pipelines through production runtime environments. Aqua Enterprise runs on-prem or in the cloud, at any scale.

For deployment of Aqua Enterprise, please see these deployment procedures:
* [**Quick-start deployment**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/deployments/tree/6.0/orchestrators/kubernetes/quick_start) for proofs-of-concept (POCs) and environments intended for instruction, development, and test
* [**Manifests**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/deployments/tree/6.0/orchestrators/kubernetes/manifests) for current Aqua Enterprise deployment manifests for all Kubernetes platforms and OpenShift
